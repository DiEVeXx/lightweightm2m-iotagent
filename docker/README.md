This Internet of Things Agent is designed to be a bridge between the
[OMA](https://www.omaspecworks.org/)
[Lightweight M2M](https://www.omaspecworks.org/what-is-oma-specworks/iot/lightweight-m2m-lwm2m/)
protocol and the
[NGSI](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/specifications/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2/ngsiv2-openapi.json)
interface of a context broker

It is based on the
[FIWARE IoT Agent Node.js Library](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).
Further general information about the FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its
architecture and the common interaction model can be found in this repository.

This project is part of [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/). For more information
